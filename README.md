# Process-Scheduling-System
Here, I implemented processes which will be done using process control block. Each process is represented/handled/controlled in the operating system by a process control block (PCB). Process control block will contain Process state (New, Ready, Running, Waiting and Terminated), Process Id, Arrival, Execution status and an option for scheduling algorithm (Round robin and First come First serve).
Thus, vaious concepts of Operating system is used for the system to be implemented.
We used python to create the system as well as giving it a GUI look.
